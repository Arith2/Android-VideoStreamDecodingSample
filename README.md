# Android-VideoStreamDecodingSample

## Introduction

This sample code demonstrates how to use [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) for video frame parsing and to use the `MediaCodec` for hardware decoding. It will help to parse video frames and decode the raw video stream data from DJI Camera and output the [YUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV) data. 

## Requirements

 - Android Studio 2.0+
 - Android System 4.2+
 - DJI Android SDK 3.3
